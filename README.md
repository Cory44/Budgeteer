# Budgeteer

#### About
After tracking my finances for the last 5 years on a cumbersome and error prone Google Sheets spreadsheet I needed a
better way to track and analyze all my expenses and investments without adding numerous new tabs to a spreadsheet. That is where Budgeteer comes in.

This is currently in the very early stages, updates to come.
